# Overview
- This project aims to analyze the factors influencing happiness across different countries using clustering techniques based on various socio-economic indicators. The primary goal is to provide insights into how different variables relate to the happiness scores of populations.

- The analysis utilizes KMeans clustering to categorize countries into distinct groups based on metrics such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, and freedom levels.

## Key Features
Data Analysis: The project conducts a thorough examination of happiness indicators, leveraging a dataset that includes economic and social metrics.

- Clustering Model: KMeans clustering is used to group countries, enabling the identification of patterns in happiness data.

- Data Visualization: Visual representations of clusters are created, allowing for an intuitive understanding of the relationships between happiness and various factors.

- In-Depth Analysis: A comprehensive analysis is performed to explore the most significant contributors to happiness, providing a nuanced understanding of the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of happiness scores and several socio-economic features. Key attributes include:

- GDP per Capita
- Life Expectancy
- Freedom Levels
- Public Trust in Government
These features facilitate an in-depth analysis of how they relate to the happiness levels of different countries.

## Models Evaluated
The following models and techniques were implemented in the project:

KMeans Clustering: Used to segment countries into clusters based on happiness-related metrics.
